# Solution 1
The question asks for an O(1) space complexity solution which means we cannot use an external data structure to store values of the first half of the linked list to compare with the second. This would be a very straightforward solution but would have O(n) space complexity.

This solution reverses the first half of the linked list then uses two ListNode pointers to iterate from the middle of the linked list outwards, checking the list for a palindrome. The high-level steps are:
1. Get list length
2. Get starting position of reverse pointer (first half)
3. Reverse linked list up to one node before this point
4. Position the forward pointer (second half)
5. Reverse final node and start reverse pointer here
6. Iterate pointers outwards and check palindrome

Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(1)

I could improve this solution by breaking the steps into separate functions which would make the code cleaner and easier to read.

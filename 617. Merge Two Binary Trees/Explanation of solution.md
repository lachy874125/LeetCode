# Solution 1
This solution uses a recursive approach to merge the two binary trees. Tree 2 is merged into tree 1 with the function eventually returning tree 1. The first two `if` statements handle the three cases where at least one of `root1` and `root2` are `nullptr`. If exactly one of  `root1`  and `root2` are `nullptr`, the solution returns the one that isn't `nullptr`, as the tree from that branch onwards will require no further merging.  If neither `root1` or `root2` are `nullptr`, the values of the two roots are summed into `root1` and the function is recursively called, passing the left children and then the right children of `root1` and `root2`. The function then returns `root1`.
